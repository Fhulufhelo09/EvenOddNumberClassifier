This project classify numbers within a given range based on specific criteria such as divisibility by 2, 5, and 100. The project identifies and categorizes numbers into three groups:

Even Numbers: Numbers divisible by 2.
Odd Numbers: Numbers that are not divisible by 2 and are also not divisible by 5.
Numbers Divisible by 100: Special cases where numbers are divisible by both 2 and 100.
